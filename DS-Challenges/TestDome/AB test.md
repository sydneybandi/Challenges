**Your company is running a test that is designed to compare two different versions of the company’s website. Version A of the 
website is shown to 60% of users, while version B of the website is shown to the remaining 40%. The test shows that 8% of users who 
are presented with version A sign up for the company’s services, as compared to 4% of users who are presented with version B.
If a user signs up for the company’s services, what is the probability that she/he was presented with version A of the website?**


```
P(Version A/Sign up) = [p(Sign up/Version A) * P(Version A)] / P(Sign up)
                     = [p(Sign up/Version A) * P(Version A)] / [{p(Sign up/Version A) * P(Version A)} + {p(Sign up/Version A) * P(Version A)}]
                     = [0.08 * 0.6] / [{0.08 * 0.6} + {0.04 * 0.4}]
                     = 0.75
                     = 75%
```
